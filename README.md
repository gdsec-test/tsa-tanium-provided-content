# tsa-tanium-provided-content
This repo contains Tanium Content provided directly by Tanium, whether supported or unsupported.

Examples include:
* Tanium module or solutions XML files signed by Tanium for upgrade management;
* Tanium Labs content available as a Solution in Tanium development environments, but must be signed prior to importing into Production; or
* TAM-provided content written by Tanium, but not necessarily officially supported.

Content in this repository, in general, should not be modified by GoDaddy except to sign unsigned content with KeyUtility for Tanium Production. Modifications to content itself are considered Custom Content and belong elsewhere.

Perhaps this repo would be better named `tsa-tanium-provided-content`?
